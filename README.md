Just paper...

Add the `white paper` class to a `<div>` or `<p>` element and see what happens.

Paper classes available:
* white # Standard issue
* legal # Legal pad
* engineer # Engineering Computation Paper (ECP)

Within a div, you can have `<p>` elements, or `<ul> / <ol>` elements with `<li>`s and their spacing should be fine. `<li class='completed'>` will grey out and strikethrough the text.

Individual `<p>` elements can become paper, as well.
